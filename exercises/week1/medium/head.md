# Head

Write a function `head` that takes an array as first argument `arr` and a second argument `n` that should be a number. The function should return the `n` first elements in the array.
When you're done, write another function `tail` that returns the last `n` elements in the array.

**Example**

```
head([4, 10, 3, 6, 5], 3) // -> [4, 10, 3]
tail([4, 10, 3, 6, 5], 3) // -> [3, 6, 5]
```
